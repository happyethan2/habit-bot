# HabitBot

HabitBot is a Discord bot that helps a group of friends track daily habits, levels up the group through ranks as they complete challenges, and enforces accountability by ranking down when targets are missed.

## Features

* **Habit Tracking**: Log multiple habits per day with `!checkin`.
* **Progress Visualization**: View weekly completion bars with `!progress`.
* **Rank System**: Unlock new challenges each week via predefined ranks.
* **Automatic Task Upgrades**: When a habit‚Äôs target increases (e.g., reading 10‚Üí20 pages), the new target replaces the old one in cumulative lists.
* **Manual Rank Control**: Promote or demote group rank with `!rankup`/`!rankdown`.
* **History Viewing**: Review past week‚Äôs check-ins with `!history`.
* **Developer Override**: Force a check-in for any user with `!forcecheckin` (restricted to bot owner).

## Rules & Mechanics

1. **Weekly Cycle**: Weeks run Monday‚ÄìSunday. Each Monday the group may rank up or down based on performance.
2. **Rank Up**: To rank up, **every** member must meet **all** weekly targets.
3. **Rank Down**: If **all** members miss **at least one** target, the group ranks down.
4. **Stasis**: If neither condition is met (partial success), the group stays at its current rank.
5. **Unlocks**: Each rank unlocks one or two habits. You can only `!checkin` habits unlocked at or below the current group rank.
6. **Task Replacement**: When a habit‚Äôs volume increases at a later rank (e.g., reading 10‚Üí20 pages), the higher-volume target replaces the lower one in cumulative lists.

### New: Reaction‚Äëbased Daily Check‚Äëins (6:00 Adelaide)

- Every morning at **06:00 Australia/Adelaide**, the bot posts a **Daily Check‚Äëin** embed in `#check-ins` with one emoji per habit unlocked at the current rank.
- **Click a reaction to log the minimum/default** for that habit (e.g., üßò logs meditation for 30 min at Rank 7).  
  - Want to log **more than the minimum**? Use `/checkin` as usual (custom values take precedence over reactions).
- **Undo**: remove your reaction to un‚Äëcheck the default value for that day. If you logged a **custom** value via `/checkin`, removing the reaction does **nothing** (we don‚Äôt override custom entries).
- **Backfill**: React on **yesterday‚Äôs** (or any day‚Äôs) check‚Äëin message to write to **that date**.
- Confirmations go to **`#check-in-logs`** to avoid cluttering `#check-ins`.

#### Channels & permissions
- `#check-ins`: Only reactions and the `/checkin` command should be used here (configure channel perms in Discord; the bot already warns if other commands are used).
- `#check-in-logs`: A read‚Äëonly channel for confirmation messages (‚Äú‚úÖ Ethan checked meditation for 2025‚Äë08‚Äë11‚Äù). Create this channel if it doesn‚Äôt exist.
- Bot requires: **View Channel**, **Send Messages**, **Add Reactions**, **Read Message History**, optional **Manage Messages** (to remove unknown reactions).

#### Admin
- `/postcheckin <date>`: Re‚Äëpost the check‚Äëin embed for a given date (`YYYY-MM-DD`, `today`, `yesterday`). Admin‚Äëonly.
