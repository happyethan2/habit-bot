# HabitBot

HabitBot is a Discord bot that helps a group of friends track daily habits, levels up the group through ranks as they complete challenges, and enforces accountability by ranking down when targets are missed.

## Features

* **Habit Tracking**: Log multiple habits per day with `!checkin`.
* **Progress Visualization**: View weekly completion bars with `!progress`.
* **Rank System**: Unlock new challenges each week via predefined ranks.
* **Automatic Task Upgrades**: When a habit’s target increases (e.g., reading 10→20 pages), the new target replaces the old one in cumulative lists.
* **Manual Rank Control**: Promote or demote group rank with `!rankup`/`!rankdown`.
* **History Viewing**: Review past week’s check-ins with `!history`.
* **Developer Override**: Force a check-in for any user with `!forcecheckin` (restricted to bot owner).

## Rules & Mechanics

1. **Weekly Cycle**: Weeks run Monday–Sunday. Each Monday the group may rank up or down based on performance.
2. **Rank Up**: To rank up, **every** member must meet **all** weekly targets.
3. **Rank Down**: If **all** members miss **at least one** target, the group ranks down.
4. **Stasis**: If neither condition is met (partial success), the group stays at its current rank.
5. **Unlocks**: Each rank unlocks one or two habits. You can only `!checkin` habits unlocked at or below the current group rank.
6. **Task Replacement**: When a habit’s volume increases at a later rank (e.g., reading 10→20 pages), the higher-volume target replaces the lower one in cumulative lists.
